After so many years working in development of software, I could notice that the biggest problem is the total alienation of the IT world with the reality itself. Is software a mere human construction? There is something in the very fabric of the creation that directly relates to software? Those are some of the many questions I wish to answer. I will try to look to software development not as a mere human invention, but as a thing that is predefined by the very fabric of the created world.
